                            <p>The principle idea of this project is to create an app via which patients will not have to look for doctors. This app will find you the most suitable/expert and nearest doctor according to your disease.</p>

                            <h3>Personality Analysis</h3>
                            <p>This project concentrates on analyzing one’s personality on the basis of what a user shares on their social media sites. Let us take Twitter for example, a user’s tweets are gathered from his profile, pre-processed, features are pulled, and then sent to a personality prediction algorithm. The best part of this project is that the person can comprehend the outcomes with 8 various types of graphs which are rendered as output displaying percentages of each trait.</p>

                            <p>What if we have a central repository for all our photos, videos, and music that are already stored on various devices so that these files are available on not only the devices on the home broadband network but anywhere in this world? All members of the family with access to the network would be able to access the files, creating a common space for sharing content. A network access storage (NAS) drive with a home Cloud setup will come to your rescue</p>
